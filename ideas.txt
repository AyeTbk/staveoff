Base gameplay is basically breakout, but instead of going through
levels by clearing the bricks of a screen, instead the difficulty
increases the longer the game has been going, with the whole wall
of bricks coming down, one step at a time, slow at first then
faster and faster, kind of like Space Invaders but there are always
new bricks appearing from the top of the screen.

As the bricks start appearing faster and become more difficult to
break, you need to get upgrades/level up to be able to keep up
with them. The paddle (player) is destroyed if it comes in contact
with a brick.

Brick ideas:
- bricks that take multiple hits to be destroyed.
- bricks that, when hit, fall down (gotta dodge!).
- portions of the onslaught could start descending really fast but
   it would have paths through it, the player has to dodge through
   the paths like a precision mouse game.
- ...?

Buffs ideas:
- Classic power ups falling from destroyed bricks?
- XP + levels or buff items (survivor like)?
- Recall the ball?
- ...?
